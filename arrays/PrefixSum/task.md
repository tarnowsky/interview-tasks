## Task Description
Given an array arr[] of size n, its prefix sum array is another array prefixSum[] of the same size, such that the value of prefixSum[i] is arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2] â€¦ arr[i]

---
### Solution
Iterate through arr, sum elements cumulatively, and store the results in a new array.

### Constraints and Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
