## Task Description
Given an input of two arrays that represent computers' power output (powerOutputs) and boosted output (boostedOutputs) and a maximum allowed power (powerMax), return the maximum amount of adjacent computers that are less than or equal to powerMax given the formula totalPowerOutput = powerOutputs[i] + powerOutputs[i + 1...] + (boostedOutputs[i] + boostedOutputs[i + 1...] * numOfAdjacentComputers).
